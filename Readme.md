# Image Processing Project

This code loads a PNG image, applies Gaussian blur, converts it to greyscale, and plots histograms of pixel intensity. The code was written by the aid of Jupyternotebook co-pilot and ChatGPT was used to refine some errors that emerged

## Features
- Greyscale conversion
- Gaussian blur
- Histogram visualization with Matplotlib


## Requirements
- python version: 3.10
- Pillow
- Matplotlib
- Scipy
